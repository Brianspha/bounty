Bounty DApp

An application that allows people to post Bounties for Bounty hunters to solve
As a job poster, I can create a new bounty. I will set a bounty description and include
the amount to be paid for a successful submission. I am able to view a list of bounties
that I have already posted. By clicking on a bounty, I can review submissions that have

been proposed. I can accept or reject the submitted work. Accepting proposed work will
pay the submitter the deposited amount.
As a bounty hunter, I can submit work to a bounty for review.
